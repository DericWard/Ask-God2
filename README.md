## Usage
Once the app is running, you can ask "God" anything by typing your queries into the input field and pressing the "Ask Now!" button. The app will generate an answer using ChatGPT, which will be displayed on the screen. While users are waiting for "God" to generate their response, worthy quotes from notable people will appear spontaneously onscreen.

What's more, users can store their chosen dialogues with "God" and download them via the "History" tab in the main menu.

Finally, if users have comments, criticisms or suggestions on how "God" might improve, the app features a contact form for just this purpose.
